# JDBC Statement types

## Statement

Use this for general-purpose access to your database. Useful when you are using static SQL statements at runtime. The Statement interface cannot accept parameters.

## PreparedStatement

Use this when you plan to use the SQL statements many times. The PreparedStatement interface accepts input parameters at runtime.

## CallableStatement

Use this when you want to access the database stored procedures. The CallableStatement interface can also accept runtime input parameters.
